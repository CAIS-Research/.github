# About Us
This is the institutional *GitHub* account of the [*Center for Advanced Internet Studies* (CAIS)](https://www.cais-research.de/) located in Bochum, Germany. Researchers at  *CAIS* study the social, political, economic, cultural and technical changes brought about by the process of digitalization. In our research programs, we combine different topics and methods across disciplines, ranging from the social sciences and humanities to computer science.

This account is maintained by the team [*Research Data & Methods* (RD&M)](https://www.cais-research.de/en/research/rdm-research-data-methods/) which conducts interdisciplinary research on and with new types of data, such as digital traces from social media. In addition to providing in-house consulting and training on topics related to research methods, data, tools, and open science, the team RD&M also creates publicly available guidelines and training materials.

This account hosts the materials created by the team RD&M as well as other open source materials created by researchers at *CAIS*. You can find further interesting open source materials in the repositories within the individual accounts of our members [Johannes Breuer](https://github.com/jobreu), [Marco WÃ¤hner](https://github.com/marcohhu), [Hendrik Heuer](https://github.com/h10r), and [Pauline Heger](https://github.com/pauline05019).
